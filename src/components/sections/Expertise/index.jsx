              <p className="typography-08">Our projects come in many shapes and sizes. Whether it is telling explanatory stories with illustration, enabling users to explore and find their own stories within interactive experiences or using animation and documentary filmmaking to guide audiences through complex subjects.</p>
              <p className="typography-08">Sometimes projects require the combination of both explanatory and exploratory approaches to meet the needs of different users.</p>
              <p className="typography-08">Weâ€™ve applied this visual storytelling to different formats; for print, video, editorial, blogs, social media, PDFs, presentations, and microsites.</p>

              <p className="typography-08">Using specialized expertise from the collective in fields such as data science, 3D, video, design and development we've produced enhanced editorial experiences that provide clarity in complexity across a range of industries and social issues.</p>
              <p className="typography-08">We make connections between disciplines and issues in unconventional ways to increase interdisciplinary understanding.</p>
              <p className="typography-08">We typically separate projects into a few stages based on the format, as a small team we move forward without information loss through heavy handoffs between phases.</p>
