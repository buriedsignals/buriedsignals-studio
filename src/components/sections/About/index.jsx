            <p className="typography-09">After leading large production teams for agencies I created an independent studio to publish data-driven stories for NGOs. I was awarded a grant by the Pulitzer Center and a scholarship for Columbia&apos;s summer data journalism program, after which I took on a staff position for the Swiss newspaper 20 Minuten.</p>
            <p className="typography-09">My work sits at the intersection of documentary filmmaking and data visualization â€”using maps, charts, and visual evidence to reveal patterns that matter.</p>
            <p className="typography-09">Beyond my own investigations, I&apos;m building AI-powered tools that help local journalists find and tell data stories. The goal is simple: make investigative techniques accessible to every newsroom, regardless of size or resources.</p>
